						<h1>Personal Online Portfolio</h1>
						<div class="tags">
							<p class="ptags">HTML/CSS, React</p><br>
						</div>
						<p class="description">I created this online portfolio to compile all of my work and future projects I will complete. I coded this website from scratch using HTML, CSS and basic JavaScript 
							to create a portfolio that fit the design I envisioned. When I began creating this website, I knew that I would need the basic components to introduce myself and create a space to display 
							my work. To write my code I use Visual Studio code and host my website from Github pages.</p>
						<div class="description">
							<h2>Currently working on -</h2>
						</div>
						<div class="description">
							<ul>
								<li>Updating my website to use React instead of just HTML and CSS</li>
								<li>Brainstorming new features I can include and old features I can improve on</li>
								<li>Creating a photo gallery to display my film photography</li>
							</ul>

								<h2>Challenges -</h2>
							</div>
							<div class="description">
								<p>Starting this website from scratch included many obstacles I had to overcome, such as the fact that I had never coded anything with HTML/CSS before and am currently in the process of learning 
									React since I have since become more comfortable HTML/CSS. A lot of this website was trial-and-errorbut eventually I started to pick up new skills from tutorials and design communities I joined. There is 
									still a lot of room for improvement and cleaning up my code, but this portfolio is a continuous project that I will work on to improve and tweak as I go along.</p>
