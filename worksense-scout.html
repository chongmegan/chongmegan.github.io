				<h1>Worksense Analytics</h1>

				</div>
				<p class="description">As a part of Northeastern's student-led design studio, Scout, I had the opportunity to work with a talented team of designers and developers in bringing Worksense to life. Our team was assigned to help our client create an identity and completely rebrand their company. This 
					included a brand new marketing website, logo, and design strategy that my team had to ideate and pitch in weekly client meetings.
				</p>

					<h2>Overview</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="description">
					<p>As one of the developers on this project, I was in charge of coding the marketing website and working closely alongside the designers to give critique as well as ensuring precise and accurate replication of their designs. I learned a lot working with my peers
						and creating a working and polished product for a real-world client for the first time.
					</p><br>
						<p class="list">These are some of the skills and tools that I used during this process:</p>
							<ul class="description-list">
								<li>Figma (for wireframing and ideation)</li>
								<li>React/Gatsby JS</li>
								<li>Contentful CMS</li>
								<li>Github</li>
								<li>Weekly presentations and critique</li>
							</ul>

					<h2>Design Strategy -</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="description">
						<p>The process began with moodboarding and determining a design strategy that encapsulated the mission and goals of Worksense. After pitching numerous design directions to the clients, we finally decided on 
							a natural and free-flowing design, inspired by warm and understated.

						<h2>Hi-fi Wireframes -</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="description">
						<p>Creating lo-fi and hi-fi wireframes for this project required multiple iterations in order to keep up with the client's preferences while also deciding on what was feasible to complete within
							the time frame of a single academic semester. As a developer, I attended multiple critiques and met with my team to determine our tech stack and delegate responsibilities throughout the project.
							Here are a few examples of some of the wireframes that were created and iterated on throughout the project.
