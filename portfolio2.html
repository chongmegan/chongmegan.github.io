					<p>When I began creating this website, I knew that I would need the basic components to introduce myself and create a space to display my work. To write my code I used the Sublime text editor and hosted my website from Github.</p>

						<p>Starting this website from scratch included many obstacles I had to overcome, such as the fact that I had never coded anything with HTML/CSS before. A lot of this website was trial-and-error but eventually I started to pick up new skills from tutorials and design communities I joined. There is still a lot of room for improvement and cleaning up my code, but this portfolio is a continuous project that I will work on to improve and tweak as I go along.</p>
