						<p>I have never been a part of a design studio before and have not had much experience working as a developer. I have faced a few challenges so far

							to work collarboratively with my team as well as using a content managing system has been a challenge thus far.

						<p class="description">I created this online portfolio to compile all of my work and future projects I will complete. I coded this website from scratch using HTML, CSS and basic JavaScript 
							to create a portfolio that fit the design I envisioned. When I began creating this website, I knew that I would need the basic components to introduce myself and create a space to display 
							my work. To write my code I use Visual Studio code and host my website from Github pages.</p>

								<p>Starting this website from scratch included many obstacles I had to overcome, such as the fact that I had never coded anything with HTML/CSS before and am currently in the process of learning 
									React since I have since become more comfortable HTML/CSS. A lot of this website was trial-and-errorbut eventually I started to pick up new skills from tutorials and design communities I joined. There is 
									still a lot of room for improvement and cleaning up my code, but this portfolio is a continuous project that I will work on to improve and tweak as I go along.</p>
